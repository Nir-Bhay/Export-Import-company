# Export-Import Project Audit Report

Generated by OpenClaw assistant — a concise audit and action plan for Nir-Bhay/Export-Import-company.

## Summary of findings
- Contact email appears repeatedly as `naazscrap@yahoo.com` in index.html (multiple locations). There are inconsistent addresses shown in client screenshots; confirm canonical contact email.
- Placeholder text `[COMPANY NAME]` exists in About section (index.html:1270) and must be replaced with the actual company name.
- Google Maps embed currently points to an address in Mundra, Gujarat (see index.html:4040). Confirm correct map coordinates/address.
- IEC and certification badges exist but some may be low-resolution; IEC number present (3712000472) in index.html.
- Product images and slider config observed in index.html; slider speed not controlled by explicit `autoplay` keywords — likely handled by CSS/JS component.

## File-level map (excerpt)
See `audit/filemap.txt` for full grep results. Key locations:
- index.html:1270 — About placeholder `[COMPANY NAME]`
- index.html:402,1228,1639,2167,2870,3842,3882,4026,4445 — occurrences of `naazscrap@yahoo.com`
- index.html:4040 — Google Maps iframe embed
- index.html:409,4348 — IEC references and IEC NO.

## Priority change list
High priority:
1. Normalize contact email (update all index.html occurrences). Risk: user contact may break if changed incorrectly — confirm with client.
2. Replace `[COMPANY NAME]` placeholder with the real company name.
3. Fix Google Maps embed to the exact address provided by client.

Medium priority:
1. Replace IEC/certification badge images with high-res official assets.
2. Replace product images as per client-provided photos.
3. Update team/member placeholders with real names/photos.

Low priority:
1. Adjust slider autoplay speed (JS config).
2. Minor styling tweaks in footer (font-weight/spacing) per screenshots.

## Questions for client (copy-ready)
1. Confirm canonical company name (exact capitalization and punctuation).
2. Confirm canonical contact email to display on site.
3. Provide correct Google Maps address or share link.
4. Provide high-resolution images for IEC/GST/DGFT badges and product photos.
5. Provide team member names and headshots for About/Team section.
6. Desired slider speed (e.g., 3s per slide).

## Next steps (recommended)
1. Confirm answers to the client questions above.
2. Replace contact/email and placeholder in a single PR with smoke tests (preview site locally).
3. Replace images and update slider config in a follow-up PR.
4. QA on mobile (viewport widths) to ensure layout intact.
